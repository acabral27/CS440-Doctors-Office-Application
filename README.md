Doctor’s office is an application that allows patients to seamlessly book appointments
with any specialist within their network, view the locations of each specialist, as well as easily
see both their upcoming appointments as well as the location of that appointment. In order to
implement most of the functionality the team used a MYSQL schema containing three tables:
‘patients’, ‘medicalprofessionals’, and ‘appointments’. This is where all the information used
throughout the application is stored. The patients and medicalprofessionals tables are also used
to differentiate which login portal should be displayed when the user logs in.
